# Service

Kotlin microservice template produces self-executable jar application. For brevity, double-space
formatting is used. [`Ktor`](https://ktor.io/) is included to mock Digital Ocean healthy checks.

## Usage

Make sure you are signed in to your GitHub account, then just
click [`here`](https://github.com/demidko/service/generate) to use template.

## Build

Execute `./gradlew clean build`. Your jar will be located at `./build/libs` with `-all.jar` postfix.
